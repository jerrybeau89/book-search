# book-search
A repo that allows a user to search books

## Description
Book Search is an application that allows a user to search books in a google book search API. Users will be presented with a list of books showing a picture, title, author, and description of the book. Users will then be able to save the book to a list of book in their personal profile. Users must sign-up to use this feature. If signed in the users will be able to navigate to their saved books. From there they can keep the book or remove it from the list.
